					Hi! I'm Sheryl.
				</div>
				<div id="intro-text" class="paragraph-text">
					I recently graduated from UC Berkeley in August with a degree in Cognitive Science and am now working as a contract designer at <span class="org"><a href="https://www.gene.com/" target="_blank">Genentech</a></span>. I'm still actively searching for full-time designer jobs though, so don't hesitate to <span class="org"><a href="mailto:sheryl.chang@berkeley.edu">reach out</a></span>.

					In terms of what motivates me, I love a good challenge. And people - they are and have always been very important to me. I always find having a positive impact on others very exciting.

					In my time at Berkeley, I've been a TA for the <span class="org"><a href="https://wdd.io/" target="_blank">Web Design DeCal</a></span>, led two Web Design Teams for <span class="org"><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a></span>, and worked as a part-time User Researcher for <span class="org"><a href="https://zebraiq.com/" target="_blank">Zebra Intelligence</a></span>. In my free time, I love to do creative photography and cook. I also love meeting new people, so feel free to <span class="org"><a href="mailto:sheryl.chang@berkeley.edu">connect with me</a></span>!

					A good challenge

				<div class="motivation-par">
					I do creative photography, and the reason I'm still doing it is that it's a huge challenge. Every shoot I have with someone is different and tough in its own way. But I enjoy the challenge! I enjoy doing things that give me an opportunity to learn and grow, in that area but also as a person.

					Improving the lives of other people
