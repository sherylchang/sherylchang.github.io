					Hi! I'm Sheryl.
				</div>
				<div class="intro-text" class="paragraph-text">
					I've always been a creative at heart. As a child, I loved to draw and paint, but I wasn't confident artistically. In high school, I kept hearing that making a living as an artist would be very difficult, so I focused more on my classes and left creativity behind.
				</div>
				<div class="intro-text" class="paragraph-text">
					Then, in college, I was lucky enough to take the <span class="org"><a href="https://wdd.io/" target="_blank">Web Design DeCal</a></span>, which exposed me to the world of design for the first time. I later TA'd for this class, led web design teams in <span class="org"><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a></span>, and took various design classes to build my skillset.
				</div>
				<div class="intro-text" class="paragraph-text">
					I'm currently working as a Project Coordinator at <span class="org"><a href="https://www.gene.com/" target="_blank">Genentech</a></span>. Although I love the company's mission, it has been very difficult for me not to be doing design work there and not to be challenged creatively. To continue to cultivate the design sensibility I developed in college, I have made a few <span class="org"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Z52z5JY7d/" target="_blank">zines</a></span> and done a bit of freelance graphic design work over the past few months. But I want to make an impact with design full-time, which is why I'm <i>actively looking</i> to move into a <b>design-focused, creatively stimulating role</b>.
				</div>
				<div class="intro-text" class="paragraph-text">
					In my free time, I've been listening to a podcast about prison called <span class="org"><a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com/" target="_blank">Ear Hustle</a></span>, learning how to make <span class="org"><a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/easy-scallion-pancakes/" target="_blank">Chinese green onion pancakes</a></span> using dumpling wrappers, and writing poetry on Wednesday nights at <span class="org"><a href="http://wolfmanhomerepair.com/" target="_blank">E.M. Wolfman Bookstore</a></span>. I love meeting new people, so feel free to <span class="org"><a href="mailto:sheryl.chang@berkeley.edu">reach out</a></span>! :-)

					In terms of what motivates me, I love a good challenge. And people - they are and have always been very important to me. I always find having a positive impact on others very exciting.

					In my time at Berkeley, I've been a TA for the <span class="org"><a href="https://wdd.io/" target="_blank">Web Design DeCal</a></span>, led two Web Design Teams for <span class="org"><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a></span>, and worked as a part-time User Researcher for <span class="org"><a href="https://zebraiq.com/" target="_blank">Zebra Intelligence</a></span>.

					I do creative photography, and the reason I'm still doing it is that it's a huge challenge. Every shoot I have with someone is different and tough in its own way. But I enjoy the challenge! I enjoy doing things that give me an opportunity to learn and grow, in that area but also as a person.
