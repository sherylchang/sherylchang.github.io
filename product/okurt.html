				Overview

			<div class="section-text">
				<b>OKurt is a small and convenient yogurt package designed to make your morning more relaxing.</b> It helps people on a time crunch in the morning take a moment to slow down and relax, as well as get a healthy meal in! Inside, it has a yogurt compartment and a disposable spoon, a compartment with a face mask, a granola package (for the yogurt), and a tube of honey.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				By interviewing extreme users, we learned that people often feel rushed and stressed in the morning and have trouble deciding what to eat. This led to the question, "How might we turn time in the morning into relaxing or self-care time?" After ideation, I expanded on one of our ideas and came up with OKurt, an all-in-one package with yogurt and a face mask. I created the brand and graphics for our product and was also very involved in prototyping and user testing.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				If I could've done this project again, I would've worked a lot more on our prototypes. I think our first iteration should've been a lot more high fidelity because we were making a type of beauty product. I also think we could've iterated a lot more on our final product, specifically on the package size and on the integration of the face mask packet.

				Research
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We did some secondary and user research to gain a better understanding of the current space of breakfast.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				From secondary research, we discovered that
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Many people skip breakfast every day (<span class="source"><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/31-million-americans-skip_n_1005076">source</a></span>)</li>
					<li>People, especially millennials, value convenience for breakfast (<span class="source"><a href="https://www.nrn.com/consumer-trends/breakfast-convenience-king">source</a></span>)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Using this information, our initial statement of intent was
			</div>
			<div style="font-weight: 600" class="section-text">
				"We want to make breakfast convenient for people every day. We want to prevent people from skipping breakfast."
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				After that, we conducted user interviews with three extreme users:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>A night owl</li>
					<li>A nurse working night shifts, and</li>
					<li>A single mother</li>
				</ol>

				Here are some key quotes:

				<ol>
					<li>Linda: "Maybe if I didn't make breakfast for Grace, <b>I wouldn't feel so rushed</b>. I would get more of my own stuff done, maybe spend more time getting dressed or doing makeup."</li>

				We did some synthesis to try to uncover more interesting insights and patterns from our research.

			<div class="section-text">
				We created affinity diagrams and an empathy map.

			<!-- Key Insights -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Key Insights
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Our key insights were
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>People feel <b>rushed and stressed</b> in the morning because of a <b>lack of time</b>. They have a set amount of time from waking up to getting out the door.</li>
					<li>Breakfast involves a lot of "<b>think time</b>," time in which the user is thinking about what to eat or make for breakfast (i.e. in the morning or while buying groceries).</li>
					<li>Different members of the household <b>eat different breakfast items</b> (i.e. mother eats yogurt, child eats eggs).</li>
					<li>Some people's breakfast choices and routines are motivated by <b>nutrition</b>.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				One of the most influential POVs from our research and insights was:
			</div>
			<div id="indented-text" class="section-text">
				A single mom with a child who works regular hours seeks to stay on schedule in the morning because <b>there's a limited set amount of time for her from waking up to getting out the door</b>.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Something we realized from all of this research and synthesis is that it's not that people don't have time for themselves in the morning, but they choose not to have time for themselves. <b>People need a moment to slow down in the morning</b>.
			</div>



			<!-- Ideation -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Ideation
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Based on our key insights and research, we formulated some How Might We (HMW) questions to help us brainstorm. We thought these ones were the most interesting:

			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>HMW reduce or entirely <b>remove "think time"</b>?</li>
					<li>HMW make breakfast a <b>mandatory and wanted priority</b> in the morning routine?</li>

				After some discussion, <b>we ended up choosing the face mask + food idea</b>. We all thought it was very innovative. We were also inspired by our instructor saying that when she did face masks with cucumbers, she would put a slice on her face, then eat one, then put a slice on, then eat one, etc. We wanted to explore ways we could expand on this idea to <b>tie together nutrition and relaxation in the morning</b>.
			</div>




			<!-- Idea Expansion -->

				Idea Expansion

			<div class="section-text">
				We decided to expand the face mask + food idea into <b>OKurt, a small and convenient yogurt package designed to make your morning more relaxing</b>. In the package, there is one compartment for yogurt the user can eat along with another compartment for yogurt the user can put on their face as a face mask. We also added another smaller compartment for granola the user can mix into the yogurt they would eat.

				<ol>
					<li>We wanted to make everything about OKurt disposable to make the product more convenient and time-efficient for users in the morning. We have foil covering each compartment, with a disposable spoon attached to the edible yogurt compartment and a popsicle stick attached to the face mask yogurt compartment.</li>
					<li>The idea to add in the face mask element came from our insight that people feel rushed and stressed in the morning. We wanted to give users a way to relax.</li>
					<li>The yogurt mask takes 5-10 minutes; then, the user can wash it off with warm water. The user can multitask and do other things while they have the mask on.</li>
					<li>The face mask yogurt is edible as well, in case the user gets confused or decides to take OKurt to-go.</li>
					<li>The yogurt for eating has different flavors, like strawberry, blueberry, and peach. The face mask yogurt is plain.</li>

				Initial Prototype

			<div class="section-text">
				I did some online research to see if anything like OKurt already exists. I didn't find anything like OKurt, but I did discover that oatmeal and honey can be added to a yogurt face mask and are great for the skin. I then drew up some variations of OKurt with oatmeal and/or honey instead of granola.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We also wanted to explore different ways to package the yogurt. I did some quick A/B testing of the variations with my friend Kevin using these drawings.

				For our second iteration, we used a much higher-quality box, with a magnetic clasp. We kept the same general structure and features from our first prototype.

				Making the assumption that most men do not know much about skincare or face masks, we <b>tentatively decided on females as our target audience</b>. I created a simple brand for the product, using a simple and light pink color paired with a dark gray for the logo. I used the light pink color since I thought it made sense for a beauty product like ours. I also created a cute catchphrase to go along with the product: "yogurt that makes everything OK."
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We wanted the packaging for the face mask to be more like a beauty product instead of a food item. Our first version of the packaging was to put it in a small cosmetic cream container. Our second version was to use a traditional face mask packet with a traditional face mask inside (not using yogurt). I created a graphic for the packet.

			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Because the users had trouble opening the box, we <b>taped down the paper</b> covering the box better. We also <b>drew an arrow</b> pointing to the side clasp, so people would know where to open it.</li>
					<li>The female user said <b>she liked the face mask packet better</b>, so we decided to use that instead of the cream container. I <b>created a back side</b> for the face mask packet with our brand name and brief instructions.</li>
					<li>Since we weren't using yogurt anymore for the face mask, and the purpose of the oatmeal was to be part of the mask, we <b>switched out the oatmeal for granola</b>. We thought granola would taste better with the yogurt.</li>

				If I could do this project again, <b>I definitely would've worked a lot harder on the prototypes</b>.

					<li>I also would've urged our group to iterate much more on our second prototype. Yes, it was a lot more high-fidelity than our first one, but we should've made it disposable-looking to fit our goal of making the user's morning stress-free and more convenient.
