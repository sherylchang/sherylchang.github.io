				Overview
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<b>Corgi-Bot is a mobile, corgi-shaped robot on the UC Berkeley campus that delivers physical messages to people.</b> Users can use the Corgi-Bot app to write and send a message to a friend and choose the message's on-campus pick-up location.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				While conducting user interviews for initial user research, my friend told me that she enjoyed running into friends on campus and seeing a cappella groups perform on Sproul. After affinity mapping with my team, we generated the key project insight that people relish having “good hindrances” while traveling through campus, which led to Corgi-Bot's creation. I further led our usability testing phase and created the screens for our app prototype to get feedback from our target audience.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				If I could've done this project again, I would've made the Corgi-Bot app interface more high fidelity, fleshed out the product interaction more, and tested out the pick-up location interaction with users.

			<div class="subtitle">
				User Journeys

			<div class="section-text">
				We also created user journeys to dig deeper into each phase of users' journeys. We wanted to better understand their thoughts and feelings and see if there were any opportunity spaces we could uncover.

				By affinity mapping, we discovered some very interesting insights and themes from our research. For instance, people like good hindrances on their commutes, and transportation can be a means for cultivating a sense of mindfulness.
			</div>



			<!-- Key Insights -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Key Insights
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>While buses can reduce commute time, people avoid them because aligning their schedules with the bus schedule takes <b>too much brain power/mental energy</b> (which is seen as a form of currency).</li>
					<li>Individuals are less likely to view being late negatively if they run into friends on campus -- this is <b>experienced as a good hindrance</b> during a user's commute.</li>
					<li><b>A journey is guided by the user's decisions</b> to reach their destination, but there are steps in a journey that are optional and/or not planned for.</li>
					<li><b>Wheelchair users are dependent on personal assistance</b> on public transit and cannot act independently. Wheelchair users will then avoid public transit due to the social cost and stress related to ostracization.</li>
				</ol>

				Feedback
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Users liked the <b>old-fashioned sense of the mailbox</b> (i.e. how they could mail and receive <b>handwritten</b> letters with the voice activation). However, they did mention that the <b>touch screen was more efficient</b> and was better in terms of <b>error correction</b>.</li>
					<li>With the voice activation interface, they were <b>confused about who they were sending the message to</b> (back to the sender or to a different friend).</li>
					<li>For their replies, users <b>favored writing their own custom messages</b> over using templates.</li>

				Iteration
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				While we were discussing how to iterate on our idea, we talked about Kiwi-Bot, the on-campus food delivery service, and corgis! As a group, we decided to rebrand our product as <b>Corgi-Bot</b>.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Our prototype was almost exactly the same -- we just stuck a post-it with a corgi drawing on it on the front of the mailbox -- but we changed the interaction.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>We decided to turn the screen interface into a <b>phone app</b> because users thought it was more efficient. This way, users could write and send messages to their friends on-the-go.</li>
					<li>We wanted to keep the old-fashioned sense of the physical message though. We accomplished this by <b>having people pick up their messages from Corgi-Bot</b> from various places on campus. Corgi-Bot would print out a message on paper for the recipient.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>



			<!-- Further User Testing -->

			<div class="section-text">
				Then, Ru-Ping and I did a second round of user testing, this time with Corgi-Bot. We again approached students who were tabling on Sproul and tested them in pairs.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				For each pair, User A played the message sender, and User B played the message receiver.
				<ol>
					<li>Ru-Ping facilitated User A going through the phone app user interface and sending a message to User B.</li>
					<li>Then, the message would be electronically sent to Corgi-Bot (me).</li>
					<li>Afterwards, I would go up to User B, write down the message User A had sent to User B on a post-it, and give it to User B. This was to model the interaction of Corgi-Bot printing out User B's message from User A.</li>

					<li>Thought it might be a better idea to have Corgi-Bot <b>send a notification</b> to a user's phone and have that user go to <b>pick the message up</b> (instead of Corgi-Bot going directly to the user's location)</li>

				We decided to take our users' feedback and have Corgi-Bot send a notification to a user's phone and have that user go to pick the message up when it was convenient for them. That way, picking up the message also wouldn't be a problem if the user was rushing to class.

				<ol>
					<li>Our key insight that people like good hindrances on their commute was very powerful, but I also think that I could've dug deeper when my interviewee was telling me about it.

					<li>The mailbox and phone app screens that I created were just enough for people to understand the interaction they displayed, but if I could do the project again, I definitely would've made them higher-fidelity.

					<li>This project was the first time I did synthesis, and <b>I learned that affinity diagramming and other methods of synthesis can uncover a lot of interesting insights, themes, and opportunity spaces.</b></li>
					<li>TI felt a little lost throughout this project -- I never knew exactly where we were going and what was going to happen next. It was a little scary for me not to feel in control, but I learned that this is just how the design process is. <b>It's normal for the process to be messy, and I should learn to be okay with not knowing exactly what's going on.</b></li>
