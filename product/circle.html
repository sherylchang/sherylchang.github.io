				Overview
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<b>Circle is a mindfulness app connecting you to your loved ones in times of both success and hardship.</b>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				By exploring the areas of transportation, travel, festivals, and gatherings in relation to conviviality, my group discovered that people necessarily go through the stage of being alone before and after a social event or hangout. People nowadays are also doing things alone more often (<span class="source"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-42830675">source</a></span>). We decided to focus in on this opportunity space and thought of the question, "How might we make the typical group activities inviting for single individuals? (i.e. movies, eating out, parties, etc)" to guide our design.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Through ideation, we came up with the initial idea of listening to recordings from friends encouraging you in taking self-care time for yourself. After some simple prototyping and testing, we expanded on this idea to create Circle, a mindfulness app in which you can send and receive encouraging recordings to and from your close circle of loved ones.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				If I could've done this project again, I would've made the app prototype look more polished, i.e. adding in animations for icons, fleshing out the user experience, etc. I would've also tested the app prototype with people to get their feedback and be able to iterate with a user-centric mindset.

			<div class="section-text">
				For this project, my class was given an open prompt:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Design the future of conviviality. 
			</div>


			<!-- Exploration -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Exploration
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Google defines conviviality as "the quality of being friendly and lively; friendliness."
			</div>
			<div id="resize" class="image">
				<img src="../assets/img/circle/definition.png">
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				To come up with our own definition of conviviality, we did some exploration -- we went out into the world and observed. Some of the spaces we came across were eating together, being inefficient together, ice-breakers in orientations, and public transportation. 
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				From our exploration, our initial definition of conviviality was: 
			</div>
			<div style="font-weight: 600" class="section-text">
				Forming connections by being physically or digitally present in the same space and spending time together 
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Going forward, the spaces we decided to focus on were:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Transportation (specifically waiting areas for public transportation)</li>
					<li>Virtual reality (VR)</li>
					<li>Icebreakers</li>
					<li>Deciding what to eat</li>
				</ol>
			</div>


			<!-- Secondary Research -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Secondary Research
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We did some secondary research online to gain a better understanding of these spaces and how conviviality would fit into these spaces.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We found that
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol> 
					<li>Users of public transportation perceive waiting times as longer than they actually are. This is because they find the wait unpleasant (<span class="source"><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-secret-weapon-that-can-fix-the-excruciating-wait-for-the-bus">source</a></span>)</li>
					<li>"Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. (46.6 million) experiences mental illness in a given year" (<span class="source"><a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers">source</a></span>), and people are using virtual reality exposure therapy to help (<span class="source"><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/virtual-reality-exposure-therapy-vret-2797340">source</a></span>)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				In addition, in our own experience, icebreakers aren't very effective in connecting people who don't know each other. Also in our own experience, deciding what to eat with friends can be difficult.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Using this information, our original statement of intent, more related to the topics of transportation and icebreakers, was
			</div>
			<div style="font-weight: 600" class="section-text">
				"We want to break down barriers to communication between strangers in a more effective manner."
			</div>


			<!-- User Research -->

			<div class="section-text">
				From there, we conducted user interviews with people related to our design spaces:

					<li><b>Alven</b>, an extreme user who has an almost 4-hour commute to and from work each day (public transportation)</li>
					<li><b>Denise and Johanna</b>, travelers in the airport (public transportation)</li>
					<li><b>Anya</b>, an orientation leader (icebreakers), and</li>
					<li><b>Kevin and Liz</b>, average users who go out to eat with friends (deciding what to eat)</li>

				Key Insights
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				A few of our key insights were
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Doing a goal-oriented activity together results in more bonding between people than a traditional icebreaker.</li>
					<li>People feel uncomfortable meeting new people if they're not in the mood to interact.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				One of the most influential POVs from our insights and personas was:
			</div>
			<div id="indented-text" class="section-text">
				A shy techie seeks to meet people in her community more naturally because she is uncomfortable with conventional ways of meeting new people.
			</div>


			<!-- Initial Ideation -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Initial Ideation
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Based on our key insights and POVs, we formulated some initial HMW questions to help us brainstorm.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				During this process, Henry brought up the interesting point that <b>people who go to social events alone often feel excluded and lonely</b>. For example, a guy who goes to a rush event with his friend probably feels a lot more comfortable than a guy who goes alone to the same event. This led to the How Might We (HMW) question, <b>"HMW change the status quo of going to social events alone?"</b>
			</div>


			<!-- Pivot -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Pivot
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				At this point in the process, we had thought up some additional HMW questions, but our group still had too many areas of interest. We really needed to narrow down and choose one direction to go with.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				After discussing for a while, we realized that we all thought the point Henry brought up earlier was very interesting, the point that people who go to social events alone often feel excluded and lonely.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				From here, we decided to expand on this idea and explore the <b>connection between conviviality and being alone</b>.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We also decided that our <b>three main themes</b> for this project should be:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Confidence</li>
					<li>Community, and</li>
					<li>Mindfulness/self-care</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				As a group, we talked about a lot of things we've observed in the past that are related to <b>conviviality x being alone</b>.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>We acknowledged that people usually have to be alone before and after a social event or hangout.</li>
					<li>Cathy is usually more productive when she does work alone, but she's even more productive when alone <i>and </i> surrounded by other students doing work (i.e. in a library) than at home.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				My friend, Stephanie, also had some thoughts on doing typical group activities alone in public. Something very insightful she said was:
			</div>
			<div id="indented-text" class="section-text">
				"It can feel uncomfortable at first -- the people you see at these activities are couples and groups usually -- but <b>it's empowering because you're doing something that isn't the social norm</b>."
			</div>


			<!-- Further Ideation -->
			<div class="section-title">
				Further Ideation
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Now focusing on conviviality x being alone, we came up with new HMW questions. We decided to use the ones below to guide our brainstorming:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>HMW stimulate users to be <b>in the mood to meet new people</b> by using visual, auditory, or smell stimulation?</li>
					<li>HMW <b>eliminate the use of phones</b> to induce more natural conviviality?</li>
					<li>HMW make spending time doing things <b>by oneself the most exciting part</b> of a social event?</li>
					<li>HMW make the typical group activities <b>inviting for single individuals</b>? (i.e. movies, eating out, parties)</li>
					<li>HMW <b>reduce the "energy barrier"</b> for people to interact? (before or during social events)</li>

				Idea Selection
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				In total, we had around 300-400 ideas, so it was pretty difficult narrowing down.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				For each HMW question, we chose a total of 8-10 of our favorite ideas for a grand total of around 45-50 ideas to work with. We organized these ideas into a Now-How-Wow matrix.

				<div class="full-width image">
					<img src="../assets/img/circle/matrix.jpg">
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				From there, we discussed as a group which ideas we should consider moving forward with. Initially, we decided on a few ideas, including a self-care app idea -- an app on which you can listen to encouraging messages recorded by your friends and family. However, we didn't feel very strongly towards any of these ideas except for the self-care app.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				After going back to our ideas and discussing with one another more, we chose to go with our <b>self-care app idea</b> and our <b>Gym Mate app idea</b>.

			<!-- Idea Expansion -->

			<div class="section-text">
				We've all been stressed or in a bad place before. We decided to expand on this idea in this way because <b>we thought that hearing voice recordings from close friends or family would help a lot during these times of hardship</b>.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				We wanted Circle to have both breathing exercises and a way to send and receive encouraging recordings to and from your loved ones. We also wanted to create a positivity feed function, where users could seek advice or encouragement from strangers.

				Initial Prototyping and Testing
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				To help us decide between our two ideas, we tested the two concepts with users.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Our process for testing Circle was as follows:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<i>A = close friend or family member</i>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<ol>
					<li>Find out how A is doing through text message, if possible, or draw from prior knowledge of A's life</li>
					<li>Ask if A would be willing to participate in testing for our app - give a brief intro of what the app is, etc</li>
					<li>Make Google Drive folder for A and leave a voice message of encouragement in the folder for A</li>
					<li>Give A a deadline to access it by (since we had a fixed time-span to test)</li>
					<li>Get feedback from A about the process and the recording after A listens to recording</li>
				</ol>

			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Here are some key quotes from our user testing:
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Kevin: "I expected it to feel a little canned, but it was <b>very nice and personal</b> - I felt like you personalized it, and it was <b>relevant to me</b>. Also, you started it with ‘Hi, Kev,' so it was like ‘this is for you.'"
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Christina: "I was slightly struggling about [...] today, and <b>hearing your encouragement helped a lot</b>."
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<b>3/4 of the users we talked to would use the app!</b> Users liked the personalization of the messages and thought it was a really cute idea. The one concern they brought up was that they thought it might be hard to get their close circle on board with the app as well. We needed to think about how to incentivize people to use our app.
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				Our results from testing Gym Mate were inconclusive, so we decided to move forward with Circle!

					<li>We hadn't drawn out the <b>Record screens</b> yet, so I drew them out. We added in a "Don't know what to say?" dropdown for users to refer to when they don't know exactly what to say in a recording.</li>
					<li>We decided to <b>simplify the Feed page's functionality</b> in terms of the user's keyboard. The new keyboard only has functions to

					<li>We wanted to make the Listen page <b>more delightful</b> -- the prompts on our original Listen page were pretty depressing (i.e. "Open when you are doubting yourself") -- so we decided to use GIFs for each prompt instead!</li>
					<li>On the Sent Recordings screen, we added a button for the user to <b>listen to a friend's recorded response</b>.</li>

				We really wanted our app to evoke <b>a feeling of brightness and cheerfulness</b>.

			<div class="section-text">
				For the first iteration of the app, I used a light orange, creamsicle-like color. I used Adobe Illustrator to create some initial logos for us to choose from.

				We wanted to test out a pinwheel logo because we thought it would make sense for our product. Pinwheels move in a <b>circular motion</b>, representing our product name, Circle. Pinwheels also have a <b>peaceful feeling</b> to them, which related to our desire for the app to be calming and to help people de-stress. 
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				My group members liked the orange pinwheel the best, so we ended up going with that for the logo.

				I wanted to choose a round font to make the app seem a bit more playful, but I also didn't want it to be overtly round. I decided to go with <b>Antipasto Pro</b> for the main font and used <b>Open Sans</b> for small labels, i.e. for the dates on the profile graphs. I used a <b>very light grey color</b> for the app background color because I thought it would look good.

				The feedback we received from our instructors was that the orange color we used as the main app color combined with the light grey background color made the app feel <b>very sleepy</b>.

				Our goal was still to have the app evoke a feeling of brightness and cheerfulness, so after hearing this, I decided to use the same shade of orange but <b>make it much darker</b>. I also <b>changed the background color to white</b> and <b>created several more screens</b> for the app.

					<li>If I could do this project again, I definitely would've tested the app prototype with users to get their feedback and see if they had any pain points while using it. In the future, <b>I want to make sure to test every design I have with users because I believe that design is and should be extremely user-centric</b>.</li>
					<li>I also would've made the app more polished in general, i.e. adding in animations, fleshing out the UI and interaction more, etc. In the future, <b>I want to make my prototypes more polished, so users will be able to interact as much as they can with the product</b>.</li>
